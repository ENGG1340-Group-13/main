You are an invading virus, 
embarking on an epic journey through the intricate pathways of the human body.
Armed with cunning and determination, 
your mission is to penetrate the three formidable lines of defense
erected by the immune system.
First, you must conquer the physical and chemical barriers,
cleverly evading mucus traps and acidic stomach acid.
Next, prepare to face the non-specific innate responses,
where relentless macrophages and killer cells lie in wait,
ready to eliminate any intruders. 
Finally, brace yourself for the ultimate challenge:
the specific adaptive responses,
where cunning antibodies and memory cells unleash their full power. 
Will you outsmart the immune cells and triumph in this microscopic battle?
The fate of your viral empire rests in your hands!
