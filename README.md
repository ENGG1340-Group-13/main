The most powerful weapon of them is their mucus traps. 
To get through those traps, you should press the space key to get a fewer higher.  
Remember that if you not press, then you will get falling and the speed is increasing!

## Features Emplemented âœ…
### Generation of random game sets or events
1. We have random size of romms and random connections between the three rooms in the main map.
2. We have choose random cylinders appear in the end in minigame1.
3. We have random monsters and moving paths generated in minigame2.

### Various data structures for storing game status
1. We have different [structures](https://github.com/ENGG1340-Group-13/main/blob/main/GP/include.h) for storing gamer position, door, game ,level, monster in main game
2. We use [maps and vectors](https://github.com/ENGG1340-Group-13/main/blob/main/GP/mini3.cpp) to store the fragments and answers provided in minigame3.
3. We use [structures and class](https://github.com/ENGG1340-Group-13/main/blob/main/GP/maze.h) to store the map and monsters in minigame2.
4. We use [map](https://github.com/ENGG1340-Group-13/main/blob/main/GP/screenwin.h) to store the map and other status in minigame1.

### Dynamic memory management
1. We use [dynamic arrays](https://github.com/ENGG1340-Group-13/main/blob/main/GP/main.cpp) to make the player move in main game.

### File Input/Output
1. We read the [map](https://github.com/ENGG1340-Group-13/main/blob/main/GP/maze.cpp) file in the minigame2.
2. We randomly input the [obstacles](https://github.com/ENGG1340-Group-13/main/blob/main/GP/FlappyBird_map.cpp) file in the minigame1.

### Program code in multiple files
We divide our different minigames code and also the header files, so we link them together in the [makefile](https://github.com/ENGG1340-Group-13/main/blob/main/GP/makefile).

### Proper Indentation and naming styles
We all make proper indentation in the code, making sure the functions can be operated well.
We also name our variables neat and easy to know what it stands for.

### In-code documantation
We conclude all the necessary explanation to specify what we are doing insode the code.

## Library usage
We put the required folder ["local"](https://github.com/ENGG1340-Group-13/main/tree/main/GP/local) together with our code. Then if you download our code, the required library will be included.
